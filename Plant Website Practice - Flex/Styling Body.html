            <h1>WHAT IS A HANGING BASKET PLANT?</h1>
            <p>A hanging basket is a suspended container used for growing decorative plants. Typically they are hung from buildings, where garden space 
                is at a premium, and from street furniture for environmental enhancement. They may also be suspended from free standing frames sometimes 
                called hanging basket trees. One type of hanging basket is the inverted planter where plants are grown in an upside down pot and are watered 
                from the top.</p>

            <h1>STRUCTURE OF HANGING BASKETS</h1>
            <p>Hanging baskets are normally made from wire with an impervious, usually plastic, lining to retain the contents. They are filled with 
                peat-free compost usually with a water-retaining gel and controlled release fertiliser granules. Typically they are planted with bedding 
                plants and may include geraniums, fuchsia, and trailing plants around the edges such as lobelia.</p>

            <h1>STRING OF TEARS</h1>
            <p>Curio rowleyanus, syn. Senecio rowleyanus, is a flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is a creeping, perennial, succulent vine 
                native to the drier parts of southwest Africa. In its natural environment its stems trail on the ground, rooting where they touch and form 
                dense mats. It often avoids direct sunlight by growing in the shade of other plants and rocks. It is commonly known as string-of-pearls or 
                string-of-beads.</p>
                <p>"String-of-beads" and several other common names are shared with Curio herreanus (string of watermelons), which has teardrop-shaped leaves, 
                    rather than spherical.</p>

            <h1>GOLDEN POTHOS</h1>
            <p>Epipremnum aureum is a species in the arum family Araceae, native to Mo'orea in the Society Islands of French Polynesia. The species is a 
                popular houseplant in temperate regions but has also become naturalised in tropical and sub-tropical forests worldwide, including northern South 
                Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific Islands and the West Indies, where it has caused severe ecological damage in some 
                cases.</p>
            <p>The plant has a number of common names including golden pothos, Ceylon creeper, hunter's robe, ivy arum, house plant, silver vine, Solomon 
                Islands ivy, and taro vine. It is also called devil's vine or devil's ivy because it is almost impossible to kill and it stays green even when 
                kept in the dark. It is sometimes mistakenly labeled as a Philodendron, Pothos or Scindapsus in plant stores. It is commonly known as a money 
                plant in many parts of the Indian subcontinent. It rarely flowers without artificial hormone supplements; the last known spontaneous flowering 
                in cultivation was reported in 1964.</p>
                <p>The plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.</p>
